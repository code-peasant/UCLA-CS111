1. All the three test cases are contained in file test.sh
2. Upon success, make check won't output anything
3. The main.c contains all the code for lab1 part a.

==========================================
for lab1c benchmarks, below are my results.

test1:
simpsh:
./simpsh --profile --rdonly input1.txt --wronly output1.txt --wronly stderr.txt --command 0 1 2 sort -u --wait

This gives me a total amount of 0.000294 kernel time in total

bash:
time cat < input1.txt|sort -u> output1.txt

This gives a real time of 0.003s, user time of 0.001s, and a sys time of 0.002s
